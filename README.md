## Important Note: Use HTTPS for more security Using one of the following options:
- Cloudflared Tunnels.
- Certbot.

## 1. Introduction

### System Overview
The xsukax E2E Chat System is a minimalist, browser-based encrypted communication platform designed for secure messaging. Built with approximately 500 lines of code, the system prioritizes privacy through end-to-end encryption while maintaining operational simplicity.

### Purpose
The system addresses the growing need for private digital communication by providing a zero-knowledge architecture where the server cannot access message content. Unlike commercial platforms, it operates without user registration, phone numbers, or persistent data storage.

### User Base
The system targets privacy-conscious individuals requiring secure communication channels, including:
- Journalists and sources requiring confidential communication
- Privacy advocates seeking alternatives to commercial platforms
- Technical users comfortable with ID-based authentication
- Organizations requiring temporary, secure communication channels

## 2. Security Analysis

### 2.1 Implemented Security Measures

#### Encryption Architecture
```
Primary Encryption: RSA-OAEP 2048-bit (messages)
Secondary Encryption: AES-256-GCM (file attachments)
Key Exchange: RSA public key exchange via server relay
Implementation: Web Crypto API (browser-native)
```

#### Protection Against Attack Vectors

| Attack Type | Protection Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Message Interception** | RSA-2048 encryption | High - Computationally infeasible to break |
| **Server Compromise** | Zero-knowledge architecture | High - Server has no decryption capability |
| **Replay Attacks** | No message persistence | High - Messages cannot be replayed |
| **XSS Injection** | No HTML rendering of user input | High - All content text-only |
| **CSRF Attacks** | WebSocket-only communication | Medium - Limited attack surface |
| **Connection Hijacking** | Mutual consent system | High - Both parties must approve |

### 2.2 Security Vulnerabilities

#### Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **No Authentication System**
   - Risk: ID impersonation possible
   - Impact: High - Anyone can claim any unused ID
   - Mitigation: Implement ID reservation with password

2. **Lack of Forward Secrecy**
   - Risk: Session key compromise affects all messages
   - Impact: Medium - Keys regenerated per session
   - Mitigation: Implement ephemeral key rotation

3. **No Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**
   - Risk: Cannot verify message integrity
   - Impact: Medium - Tampering undetectable
   - Mitigation: Add HMAC signatures

#### Moderate Vulnerabilities
- **Short ID Space**: 8-character IDs (2.8 trillion combinations)
- **No Rate Limiting**: Client-side DoS possible
- **Plain HTTP Option**: MITM vulnerable without HTTPS

### 2.3 Incident Response Protocol

#### Detection Phase
```javascript
// Current logging implementation
logger.info(f"User {user_id} connected from {ip}")
logger.error(f"Message handling error: {error}")
```

#### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected server instance
   - Rotate all session keys (automatic on reconnection)
   - Alert connected users via system message

2. **Investigation**
   - Review `/var/log/` for anomalies
   - Analyze WebSocket connection patterns
   - Check for unauthorized server modifications

3. **Recovery**
   - No data recovery needed (no persistence)
   - Restart services: `systemctl restart chat nginx`
   - Users regenerate keys on reconnection

## 3. Privacy Assessment

### 3.1 Data Collection Practices

#### Data Collected vs. Not Collected

| Data Type | Collected | Stored | Duration | Encrypted |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **User ID** | ✓ | RAM only | Session | No |
| **Public Keys** | ✓ | RAM only | Session | No |
| **IP Address** | ✓ | Logs only | 7 days | No |
| **Message Content** | ✗ | Never | N/A | Always |
| **Private Keys** | ✗ | Never | N/A | N/A |
| **Personal Information** | ✗ | Never | N/A | N/A |
| **Device Information** | ✗ | Never | N/A | N/A |
| **Chat History** | ✗ | Never | N/A | N/A |

#### Privacy-Preserving Features
```python
# Server sees only encrypted blobs
{
    'type': 'msg',
    'from': 'AB3XY7Z9',
    'to': 'XY9PQ2RT',
    'data': 'base64_encrypted_blob'  # Unreadable
}
```

### 3.2 User Consent Mechanisms

#### Explicit Consent Implementation
- **Connection Requests**: Modal-based approval system
- **Key Exchange**: Only after mutual consent
- **File Transfers**: User-initiated only
- **Data Persistence**: Opt-in via localStorage

#### Transparency Measures
- Open-source codebase (fully auditable)
- No hidden telemetry or analytics
- Clear system messages for all actions
- Visible connection status indicators

### 3.3 Regulatory Compliance

#### GDPR Compliance Assessment

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Data Minimization** | ✓ Compliant | Collects minimal data |
| **Purpose Limitation** | ✓ Compliant | Data used only for routing |
| **Storage Limitation** | ✓ Compliant | No persistent storage |
| **Right to Erasure** | ✓ Automatic | Data erased on disconnect |
| **Data Portability** | N/A | No data to export |
| **Privacy by Design** | ✓ Compliant | E2E encryption default |

#### CCPA Compliance
- **No Sale of Data**: No data monetization
- **Opt-Out Rights**: No data collection to opt out from
- **Disclosure Requirements**: Full transparency via open source
